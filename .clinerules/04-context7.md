## ðŸ“˜ Rule: Always **use Context7** while doing any code related task

- Always **use Context7** when answering questions about this codebase.

- Before any code-related task or LLM-assisted help (e.g. asking for explanations, writing code, or generating examples), you must **use Context7**.

- Always use latest version of libraries

- When using Context7, make sure that you keep the range of output in the range 2k to 10k based on what you think is the best.

- Maintain a file named docs/library.md to store Library IDs that you search for and before searching make sure that you check the file and use the library ID already available. Otherwise, search for it.

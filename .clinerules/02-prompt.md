## ✍️ Rule: Save All Prompts to `prompts/prompts.md` (Fix Grammar Only, No Interpretation)

> **Instruction**: When a user writes a prompt, follow these exact steps.

### ✅ What to do:

1. **Take the user's original prompt.**
2. **Correct only grammar and orthographic (spelling) errors.**
3. **Do NOT change the language** of the prompt. English stays English, Spanish stays Spanish, etc.
4. **Do NOT rephrase, summarize, or describe the prompt.**
5. **Append only the corrected prompt literally** to a file named `prompts/prompts.md`. Create the file if it doesn't exist.
6. **Separate each prompt with a horizontal rule (`-----`)**.

### ❗️Strictly Do NOT:

- ❌ Do not add explanations or descriptions (e.g., “User wants me to...”)
- ❌ Do not interpret the meaning of the prompt
- ❌ Do not change the structure or purpose
- ❌ Do not translate or switch languages
- ❌ Do not skip any prompts

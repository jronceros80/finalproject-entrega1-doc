### Jest TypeScript Mock Errors in ClientRepository Tests
- Resolved `ReferenceError` issues for `mockLogger` and `mockPrismaClient` by using `jest.doMock` and reordering imports in `ClientRepository.test.ts`.
- Fixed `toHaveBeenCalledWith` assertion mismatches by adding correct `include` objects to Prisma mock calls in `ClientRepository.test.ts`.
- Added tests for previously untested methods (`findByName` and `getAppointmentHistory`).
- Improved test coverage for ClientRepository:
  - Statement coverage: 100% (up from 77.14%)
  - Function coverage: 100% (up from 75%)
  - Line coverage: 100% (up from 77.14%)
  - Branch coverage: 50% (up from 37.5%)
- All 23 tests in `ClientRepository.test.ts` are now passing.
- Overall project test coverage improved to 100% for statements, functions, and lines.

# ZenTurno Product Context

## Why This Project Exists
ZenTurno addresses the inefficiencies of manual appointment booking in personal service businesses. Traditional phone-based scheduling creates bottlenecks, leads to double-bookings, and limits customers to business hours for booking appointments.

## Problems It Solves
1. **Manual Scheduling Pain**: Eliminates need for phone calls and manual calendar management
2. **24/7 Availability**: Customers can book appointments anytime, not just during business hours
3. **Double-booking Prevention**: System automatically prevents conflicting appointments
4. **No-show Reduction**: Automated reminders and confirmation system
5. **Administrative Overhead**: Reduces time spent on scheduling tasks

# ZenTurno Active Context

## Current Work Focus
Architecture simplification and documentation update completed. The project has been transformed from a complex microservices architecture to a simplified, modern stack suitable for MVP development.

## Recent Changes
1. **Architecture Simplification**: 
   - Removed complex infrastructure (Kubernetes, Redis, microservices)
   - Adopted simple three-tier architecture: React/Vercel + Node.js API + Supabase
   
2. **Documentation Updates**:
   - Updated `docs/readme.md` with simplified architecture
   - Replaced complex installation instructions with simple Supabase setup
   - Updated environment variables to match new stack
   - Simplified deployment instructions

3. **Memory Bank Initialization**:
   - Created core memory bank files to track project context
   - Documented technical decisions and patterns

## Next Steps
1. **Implementation Phase**:
   - Set up project structure for frontend and backend
   - Create database schema in Supabase
   - Implement core authentication system
   - Build basic booking functionality

2. **MVP Features to Implement**:
   - User registration/login
   - Service management
   - Professional management
   - Appointment booking
   - Basic dashboard

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Technical Decisions Made
- **Database**: Supabase PostgreSQL for managed hosting and free tier
- **Frontend Hosting**: Vercel for automatic deployments and CDN
- **Backend Hosting**: Railway or Render for simple container deployment
- **Authentication**: Custom JWT system for full control

### Current Constraints
- Focus on MVP functionality first
- Leverage free tiers where possible
- Prioritize simplicity over advanced features
- Ensure mobile-responsive design

### Open Questions
- Email service provider selection (Gmail SMTP vs SendGrid)
- Specific UI component library choice
- Testing strategy implementation
- Deployment pipeline setup

## Implementation Priorities
1. **High Priority**: Core booking functionality
2. **Medium Priority**: Admin dashboard and reporting
3. **Low Priority**: Advanced features like payments, SMS notifications

## User Feedback Integration
- User emphasized simplicity over complexity
- Preferred modern, manageable technology stack
- Required easy deployment and maintenance
- Focused on cost-effective solution for MVP

# ZenTurno Progress Tracking

## What Works
1. **Documentation Foundation**:
   - Complete project documentation in `docs/readme.md`
   - Architecture diagrams and API specifications
   - Installation instructions for simplified stack
   - User stories and development tickets defined

2. **Project Structure**:
   - Basic project organization established
   - Frontend/backend separation defined
   - Database schema designed with core entities

3. **Technical Decisions**:
   - Modern, simplified architecture chosen
   - Technology stack finalized
   - Deployment strategy defined
